# **Students-by-race-Ethnicity**
Graphical presentation of data makes it easier to understand large amounts of data, trends, and relationships. The use of graphs, charts, and number lines in daily life helps in making an evaluation. It organizes in assessing performances, sales, and even deadlines. Seeing things visually helps us to make quicker decisions without going into detail. I, Sumayyah Ahmed, created a chart for Fall semester showing a percentage of students by race/Ethnicity at College of DuPage.
